During this phase the polices, procedures, governance structures and accountability \nmechanisms of the ODL will be put in place. Pilot projects will be initiated, evaluated and expanded. \nInformation resources will be identified, contracts for these resources will be negotiated and resources \nwill be made deployed through the ODL. Regular evaluation during this phase will ensure the ODL is \nachieving its objectives and is accountable to its key communities."

However, not all topics are suited for the \nExpert Level. For this reason, the extension syllabi are established at the Foundation Level to expand the \nISTQB program to incorporate new or updated knowledge. New extensions shall be discussed and \nintroduced by the ISTQB periodically. Extensions may be established at the Advanced Level as well, but \nthat is beyond the scope of this document."
